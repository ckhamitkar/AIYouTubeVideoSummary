       "\" Transcriber: Reihaneh Iranmanesh\\nReviewer: Elisabeth Buffard When most people think about AI, they picture a sci-fi dystopian future,\\nwith man versus machine. Terminator, Skynet, Black Mirror,\\nBlade Runner, Westworld. But as someone who is working on the most ambitious\\nAI projects in the world, every day, I can tell you\\nthat is far from reality. To me, it’s the contrary of that. AI enhances\\nand even supercharges humanity. Let me explain why. There are many reasons\\nwhy AI will never replace humans. AI always has,\\nand always will, rely on humans. That’s one of the reasons that I was actually inspired\\nto start an AI company. That and my background\\nhave had a huge impact on me and why I started Scale. My parents were brilliant scientists\\nof Los Alamos, who accomplished a lot\\nin advancing their field. That inspired me to use\\nscience and technology to have a real impact on the world. My dad was a physicist,\\nand my mom was an astrophysicist, both at the top of their field, who made meaningful contributions\\nto plasma fluid dynamics and the beginnings of the universe. Their scientific work will have \\nmeaningful impact on how we understand\\nand perceive our world. And I wanted to work\\non something as impactful or even more impactful than that. That’s why I decide\\nto become a programmer, so I can make a difference in the world. Growing up as a programmer, despite how powerful computers are, you quickly realize\\nhow limited they are. In particular, they lack\\njudgment and intelligence. Programming is the art\\nof giving clear robotic instructions to computers to accomplish\\nsimple objectives. It’s all black and white,\\nand there’s no gray area. As I learned about AI,\\nit was clearly transformational. It changed the game. It equipped computers with intelligence,\\nand I knew I wanted to be deeply involved. I was studying AI at MIT and slowly \\nbecame more and more excited about all the potential applications of AI\\nfor solving more nuanced problems. For example, there was one class project where I worked on applying AI \\nto human emotions. The goal was to take picture\\nof human expressions and ultimately identify and understand\\nthe emotion through very subtle signals in facial expressions. Using AI, we built an algorithm that was able to detect intent\\nwith 80% accuracy and efficacy. We were extremely proud of that. It was the start of using AI to do\\nentirely new things using computers. That’s when I realize\\nthe implications of AI and how it could tackle the gray areas\\nthat involve judgment or intelligence. You see, AI needs humans\\nto teach it individual values, nudge it to find thoughtful outcomes, and ensure that human intentions\\nand values are aligned with the AI. It was a revelation. Before, coding was like\\na black-and-white film versus watching in technicolor. What’s more, AI has the potential\\nto take away the repetition in our lives, meaning that new and fresh ideas\\nwill matter more and ultimately enable us to be more human. But, to power AI,\\nyou need powerful data, which was especially hard to come by\\nat that time, in 2016, while I was at MIT. I realized that nobody was building\\nanything with AI outside of school. It’s unusual for MIT students\\nto not be building something. Mechanical engineering majors\\nare building catapults in the lawn, electrical engineering majors \\nare building robots, and computer science majors are building\\napps for their friends to use. But nobody was building\\nanything using AI. That’s when I discovered what\\na bottleneck data can be to building meaningful\\nand powerful AI systems. You can't treat data as an afterthought. Bad data or lack of data\\nresults in bad AI. I even realize this in my personal life. I put a camera inside my fridge\\nto gather data, to tell me when to refill my groceries\\nand what I needed to buy. That’s when I realized\\njust how much data I needed to actually be able\\nto successfully predict what to purchase. There’s no way I could create enough data to be successful\\nwith the algorithms on my own. But it did help me discover\\nthat my roommate was stealing my food. (Laughter) At that point, I realized that this was going to be\\na pivotal problem for AI. Building large-scale,\\nhigh-quality datasets to power every single application. This was the impetus\\nbehind starting Scale: quality data, to create\\nreliable AI outcomes, requires human insight and guidance. If you think about the core setup of AI,\\nthe algorithms need data, and data needs humans. To ensure data is accurate, an expert human is often required. Only humans can understand\\nthe context and nuance to properly annotate\\nthe data to be fed to algorithms. Humans are the one who teach\\nthe algorithms what to do. They’re the ones making the decisions,\\nthey guide them. If something happens,\\nhere’s what you should do. And AI learns from that\\nand replicates it. We are teaching the AI\\nour individual values and nudging the AI\\nto find thoughtful outcomes. Machines make mistakes. We have to teach them and\\nincentivize them to tell the truth. This is why teaching the AI human\\nintentions and values is so important. It’s through this process\\nthat we will ensure that AI will have fair, ethical outcomes\\nin line with human values. It’s this alignment\\nthat we must solve for. The constant alignment of AI to human\\nintentions will always require humans. and human ideas and creativity\\ncan actually matter much more, with the power of AI behind them. The long tale of real-world problems, and the fact that there’s always\\nunknown unknowns means that humans\\nwill never be fully removed from the AI development lifecycle. For example, I remember back in 2016 when chatbots were first starting\\nto become a big thing. It was right when we were starting Scale. We were all thinking there's no way\\nto build a fully automated system. There’re so many different conversations\\nthat can have so many different pathways. It’s hard to build AI systems that can\\nproperly handle all these possibilities. For chatbots to work, there’re humans\\nbehind it who make the decisions once, and from there, the chatbots\\ncan replicate that over and over again. That’s again why it’s impossible\\nfor AI to improve or change without human input. Let’s take you to the front lines of AI. The things that AI automates first\\nare not what you might expect. An unintuitive example is the weather. Humans have tried for many millennia to crack the code\\nof how to predict the weather. It’s especially hard for meteorologists because there are\\nso many different small things that can cause massive impacts\\non the weather. It's the butterfly effect. Different elements react to one another\\nin unexpected ways. There’re so many inputs\\nthat affect the weather, way more data than any person\\nwould be able to comprehend on their own. That’s why we need AI\\nto analyze the vast oceans of data and provide more accurate, nuanced,\\nand comprehensive analysis. At the moment, AI can already provide extremely accurate\\nshort-term predictions, including for critical storms and floods. So, it’s not what humans perceive\\nto be the simplest task that AI will automate first,\\nbut rather where we have the most data. The use cases the brightest minds\\nare focusing on are much more positive\\nthan what you might think. Much more so than Terminator or Westworld. That’s again why I think AI\\nwill be a supercharger for humanity. Unlike the movies, AI developers \\naren’t focusing their attention on building replacements for humans. They’re building tools\\nto help free up our time and energy to focus on what human\\ncan uniquely solve. A good example about how AI\\ncan be used in practice is health care. According to the Association\\nof American Medical Colleges, the United States could see\\nan estimated shortage of between 38,000\\nand 124,000 physicians by 2034. AI could save doctors’ time\\nwith rogue tasks and ultimately enable them to serve\\nmore patients and help more people. Health care is full of repetitive tasks\\nwhich are right for AI. When a patient is sick,\\nthey go through all kinds of tests which produce all sorts of data:\\nblood tests, imagery, lab results, X-rays, etc. Doctors then analyze all this data\\nto make decisions about a case. AI can analyze all this data proactively and go through a list of possibilities by cross-referencing\\nagainst all prior data in cases. It can identify when something isn’t right\\nlong before a physician can and flag it to a physician,\\nif it requires more attention. With AI,\\ndoctors are still integral to the process, but it takes less time to get a diagnosis. You have to wait several weeks for your case to go\\nfrom one doctor to another. The AI will supercharge, \\nfinding a diagnosis faster. Similarly, in the field of drug discovery,\\nit’s all about using complex data: experiment data, patient data, protein simulations and far more to guide a more efficient process of solving diseas\\nthrough new drugs and compounds. Recent advancements in AI have dramatically sped up\\nthe scientific process by allowing us to process and make us\\nof more  data than ever before. Another good example, and potentially\\nmore concrete, is the Russia-Ukraine war. We've all seen the images of tanks\\nlining up ready to enter Kiev. AI can help assess satellite imagery\\nwith superhuman speed and precision, so Ukrainian forces can respond faster. At Scale, we’re using our platform\\nto do damage assessment in key areas affected by the war. We’ve rapidly analyzed\\nover 2,000 square kilometers of Ukraine, identifying over 370,000 structures, including thousands not previously\\navailable via other datasets. We focused on Kiev, Kharkiv and Dnipro, in which we provided some data \\ndirectly to government and users. We also made the data publicly available\\nto the broader AI community via Scale. We can also use this data\\nto  maximize allocations of resources, people or commodities. It’s clear satellite data\\ncan be extremely useful in these types of situations. Thanks to satellite data,\\nAI can analyze if planes or tanks have been moved from one place to another. This is called change detection. Algorithms can constantly be monitoring\\nfor this kind of data, and if it notices a change or movement, it will alert a human\\nto further investigate, otherwise known as predictive modeling. AI can also help us understand\\nthe economic impacts of war. We can use AI to track \\nfarmland in Ukraine and measure the agricultural damage\\nin real time. Ukraine is a major food supplier\\nfor much of the world. Understanding these impacts\\nis absolutely critical. In conclusion, AI is not\\nsomething to be feared, but it’s a tool that can be used\\nto better understand… that needs to be better understood, and has the potential\\nto transform our lives for the better. AI enables us to make use and sense\\nof massive amounts of data that has historically been\\nbeyond human capacity. It allows us to add\\nintelligence and nuance to automated systems\\nthat will dramatically improve humanity. Areas like health care and agriculture. This then allows humans\\nto do what they do best. Take this information,\\nput it into context with sensitivity, to strategize and act in a timely manner. AI is a supercharger for humanity. When AI is better than humans, it makes humans better. AI will automate repetitive tasks that don’t require\\nconstant human judgment or creativity, which frees us up to explore\\nand focus on fresher, newer ideas. AI will enable us to be\\neven more creative and more idea-driven, which I personally find\\nincredibly exciting. It allows us to embrace\\nthe generative aspects of human nature, so we can run faster with ideas and build better\\nand more powerful solutions to the world’s biggest problems. That’s why I believe\\nthat human-led AI is the path forward, and I’m proud to usher all of us\\ninto a future with human-led AI. Thank you. (Applause)\""

The long tale of real-world problems, and the fact that there’s always\\nunknown unknowns means that humans\\nwill never be fully removed from the AI development lifecycle. AI could save doctors’ time\\nwith rogue tasks and ultimately enable them to serve\\nmore patients and help more people. For chatbots to work, there’re humans\\nbehind it who make the decisions once, and from there, the chatbots\\ncan replicate that over and over again. Their scientific work will have \\nmeaningful impact on how we understand\\nand perceive our world. It’s especially hard for meteorologists because there are\\nso many different small things that can cause massive impacts\\non the weather. It allows us to add\\nintelligence and nuance to automated systems\\nthat will dramatically improve humanity. We can use AI to track \\nfarmland in Ukraine and measure the agricultural damage\\nin real time. We are teaching the AI\\nour individual values and nudging the AI\\nto find thoughtful outcomes. But as someone who is working on the most ambitious\\nAI projects in the world, every day, I can tell you\\nthat is far from reality. That’s when I realize\\nthe implications of AI and how it could tackle the gray areas\\nthat involve judgment or intelligence. The use cases the brightest minds\\nare focusing on are much more positive\\nthan what you might think. My dad was a physicist,\\nand my mom was an astrophysicist, both at the top of their field, who made meaningful contributions\\nto plasma fluid dynamics and the beginnings of the universe. It can identify when something isn’t right\\nlong before a physician can and flag it to a physician,\\nif it requires more attention. We’ve rapidly analyzed\\nover 2,000 square kilometers of Ukraine, identifying over 370,000 structures, including thousands not previously\\navailable via other datasets. I was studying AI at MIT and slowly \\nbecame more and more excited about all the potential applications of AI\\nfor solving more nuanced problems.'"
