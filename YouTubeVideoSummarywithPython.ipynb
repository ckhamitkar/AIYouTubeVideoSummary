       "' Otherwise known as the “Gray Ghost,” there’s\\xa0\\nalways been a sense of mystery with these dogs. In fact, there’s probably a lot of\\xa0\\nthings you didn’t know about these dogs. Like did you know they’re\\xa0\\none of the most intelligent\\xa0\\xa0 and clever dog breeds in the canine kingdom? Interested in learning what behavior\\xa0\\nis specific to the Weimaraner breed? Or how Weimaraners specialized\\xa0\\nin tracking down missile parts? If questions like these intrigue you,\\xa0\\nstick around! In today’s episode,\\xa0\\xa0 we’re counting down the 10 little known\\xa0\\nWeimaraner facts that you didn’t know. But before we dive in, hit that\\xa0\\nsubscribe button and notification bell\\xa0\\xa0 for more incredible dog facts like these. And hit that “like” button if\\xa0\\nyou want more Weimaraner videos. Number ten: Some Weimaraners\\xa0\\nhave “tiny horns” on their heads. No, we’re not saying that\\xa0\\nthese mischievous playful\\xa0\\xa0 dogs are little devils - though\\xa0\\nthey can act like one at times. And we’re also not talking about the typical\\xa0\\n“horns” that you see on rhinos, cattle or goats. Rather, there are some Weimaraners who have a tiny\\xa0\\xa0 flap of skin that sits on their\\xa0\\nhead, right above their ears. But not all Weimaraners have this, of course. It’s believed that dogs with these “little\\xa0\\xa0 horns” were descended from the\\xa0\\nHarrasburg line of Weimaraners. In fact, it’s why they’re frequently\\xa0\\nknown as the “Harrasburg Horns.” However, Weimaraners aren’t exactly\\xa0\\nspecial with this set of horns. Similar breeds, such as the Vizsla and German\\xa0\\nShorthaired Pointer, both have these horns, too. So, did you check your dog? Do they have\\xa0\\xa0 the Harrasburg Horns? Let us\\xa0\\nknow in the comments below! Number nine: Only Weimaraners are born\\xa0\\nwith this unique physical characteristic. Dog breeds that have unique coats are\\xa0\\noften born with a simple and plain coat. For example, the spotted Dalmatians don’t\\xa0\\nactually have their spots as a newborn puppy. And the Blue Heeler’s unique coats are actually\\xa0\\nsolid white when they first arrive in this world. However, the Weimaraner is the opposite. Instead of their solid-colored coats,\\xa0\\xa0 Weimaraners are actually born with tiger\\xa0\\nstripes that streak through their entire bodies. And while this looks amazing,\\xa0\\nit doesn’t last very long. In just a few days, these tiger stripes start to\\xa0\\nfade and the solid gray coats start to emerge. But stripes aren’t the only cool\\xa0\\nthing about a Weimaraner puppy. These dogs are also born\\xa0\\nwith bright, light-blue eyes. As the dog ages, the blue gradually\\xa0\\nturns into a gray or amber color. Number eight: They’re nicknamed the\\xa0\\n“dog with the human brain” for a reason. Did you know that Weimaraners are some of the\\xa0\\nsmartest and most clever dogs in the world? They’re so intelligent that they’ve apparently\\xa0\\xa0 earned themselves the nickname,\\xa0\\n“dog with the human brain.” But just how intelligent are they? For obedience and working intelligence,\\xa0\\nWeimaraners are the 25th smartest dogs. This essentially means that Weimaraners can learn\\xa0\\na new command with just 5 to 15 repetitions. Plus, they’re able to obey a known command, on the\\xa0\\nfirst attempt, with a 85% or better success rate! But what ultimately landed them the title of “dog\\xa0\\xa0 with a human brain” isn’t from\\xa0\\ntheir obedience and working IQ. Rather, it’s from their\\xa0\\nfreakishly high adaptive IQ. This type of dog intelligence refers\\xa0\\nto what the dog can learn for himself. Weimaraners are clever dogs that are great at\\xa0\\nlearning from previous mistakes and experiences. Plus, they’re some of the best\\xa0\\nproblem solvers in the canine kingdom. So does this sound like your Weimaraner?\\xa0\\nLet us know in the comments below! Number seven: They’re one of the\\xa0\\nfastest dog breeds ever on land. Weimaraners are fast dogs. After all, they were bred to hunt small and\\xa0\\nagile animals, such as rabbits, foxes and fowl. But just how fast are they? According to Parade.com, the Weimaraner\\xa0\\ncan run a remarkable 35 miles per hour! For reference, the world’s fastest\\xa0\\nhorse runs about 55 miles per hour. And the world’s fastest dog, the Greyhound,\\xa0\\ncan reach 45 miles per hour in full stride. All in all, the top speed of the Weimaraner makes\\xa0\\nthem one of the 10 fastest dog breeds alive. Number six: A Weimaraner and his owner set the\\xa0\\nworld record for fastest mile time in 2016. How do we know these dogs are some of the fastest? Well, we have some proof\\xa0\\nto back up that statement. In 2016, a man and his furry companion broke the\\xa0\\xa0 unofficial record for the “human-dog\\xa0\\nmile” in Santa Barbara, California. This race is essentially a dog on a leash,\\xa0\\nwhile the human and dog run a single mile. The dog named “Kaydom,”\\xa0\\nwas a 5 year old Weimaraner\\xa0\\xa0 who the owner rescued from\\xa0\\na shelter 3 years prior. Since then, they’ve been logging in\\xa0\\n40 miles per week as running buddies. So it’s not surprising that\\xa0\\nKaydom and his owner blazed\\xa0\\xa0 through the mile in just 4 minutes and 13 seconds. And according to the 39 year old owner,\\xa0\\nBrian Duff, he was just trying to run as\\xa0\\xa0 fast as he could to keep up with\\xa0\\nKaydom through the mile-long run. Who knew these dogs had it in them? Number five: Out of all the AKC breed standards,\\xa0\\xa0 only the Weimaraner’s breed\\xa0\\nstandard has this unusual word. Official AKC breed standards can\\xa0\\ntell you a lot about a dog breed. And oftentimes, you’ll find words\\xa0\\nthat seem to perfectly fit the bill. For example, only 4 breed standards\\xa0\\ninclude the word “majestic.”\\xa0\\xa0 One of which is the calm\\xa0\\nand magnificent Cane Corso. But did you know that the Weimaraner’s breed\\xa0\\xa0 standard is the only standard\\xa0\\nto include the word “trumpet?” And no, they’re not describing\\xa0\\nthe brass instrument. Instead, the word “trumpet” actually refers to\\xa0\\nthe protruding temples on the Weimaraner’s head. It’s pretty much the spot behind the\\xa0\\neye socket of the side of the skull. And while we still have no idea why the word\\xa0\\n“trumpet” was used to describe this trait,\\xa0\\xa0 we do know that “trumpets” are a beautiful\\xa0\\ncomplement to their facial features. Number four: There’s an unusual behavior\\xa0\\nthat’s often seen in the Weimaraner breed. Does your Weimaraner “nook?” If you don’t actually own one of these\\xa0\\ndogs, then it’s okay to be confused. Nooking refers to the behavior where the\\xa0\\ndog kneads and sucks on their stuffed toys. We still don’t have a full explanation for this,\\xa0\\xa0 but some believe that it’s caused by\\xa0\\nearly separation from their mothers. Others believe that it’s just a\\xa0\\nthing Weimaraners do for comfort. And although some say that this trait\\xa0\\nis seen specifically in Weimaraners,\\xa0\\xa0 it appears that it’s not exclusive to this breed. It’s just that Weimaraners show this\\xa0\\nbehavior far more often than any other breed. Number three: US President Eisenhower’s Weimaraner\\xa0\\nwas a huge hit with the people of America. Of all the celebrities that\\xa0\\nhave owned a Weimaraner,\\xa0\\xa0 ex US President Dwight D. Eisenhower\\xa0\\nmay be the most famous of them all. His Weimaraner’s name was Heidi, and she was a\\xa0\\npersonality that people couldn’t get enough of. When media photographers tried to snap pictures\\xa0\\nof the First Lady, Heidi would lunge at them. Newspapers would write all sorts\\xa0\\nof ridiculous stories about Heidi. For instance, one reporter stated that\\xa0\\nshe ate two poached eggs on toast,\\xa0\\xa0 along with bacon, for breakfast every single day. Others reported that her meals consisted of\\xa0\\ncooked ground beef mixed together with kibbles. And finally, there was the rug\\xa0\\nincident, where Heidi’s bladder\\xa0\\xa0 failed on a 20 thousand dollar rug in\\xa0\\none of the White House reception rooms! Since then, Heidi moved away\\xa0\\nfrom the spotlight and lived\\xa0\\xa0 peacefully at the Eisenhower farm in Pennsylvania. Number two: One heroic Weimaraner entered the\\xa0\\nAnimal Hall of Fame for saving his owner’s life.\\xa0 Not only are dogs great companions\\xa0\\nand friends, but oftentimes they’ve\\xa0\\xa0 even saved their owners’ lives.\\nWe’ve heard of these heroic\\xa0\\xa0 stories time and time again.\\nAnd on Easter Sunday in 2007,\\xa0\\xa0 a Weimaraner named Herman Jr did it again.\\nHerman’s owner got up in the middle of the night\\xa0\\xa0 feeling ill, so he decided to go for a walk around\\xa0\\nthe house and watch some late-night television.\\xa0 In a sudden, the owner collapsed and couldn’t\\xa0\\nmove while struggling to cry for help.\\xa0 Herman took notice and immediately\\xa0\\nran upstairs to wake up his wife.\\xa0 The wife woke up and, when she\\xa0\\nfound her husband, called 911.\\xa0 It was a 100-percent blockage of the coronary\\xa0\\nartery, which has just a 50% survival rate. Without the quick actions of Herman\\xa0\\nJr, his owner may not be alive today. Two years later, the heroic\\xa0\\nWeimaraner was inducted into\\xa0\\xa0 Iowa’s Animal Hall of Fame, and rightfully so. Number one: During the Cold War, one Weimaraner\\xa0\\nspecialized in locating the most unusual thing. One of the most impressive qualities of the\\xa0\\xa0 Weimaraner is the nose and as a\\xa0\\nresult, the keen sense of smell. It’s why they make excellent tracking\\xa0\\ndogs for small game and missing people. But during the Cold War, there was one Weimaraner\\xa0\\nthat specialized in tracking missile fragments. Dingo was his name. And Dingo, along with his German Shorthaired\\xa0\\npointer friend, were crucial in recovering\\xa0\\xa0 pieces of missiles so scientists could study\\xa0\\nthe success or failure of these missiles. The team of dogs worked hard\\xa0\\neveryday no matter the weather. In fact, in the intense heat,\\xa0\\nthese dogs were given a custom\\xa0\\xa0 terry-cloth jacket with pockets to\\xa0\\nhold ice cubes as a way to cool down. These dogs had a 96% recovery rate,\\xa0\\nand the program was so successful\\xa0\\xa0 that numerous military and research\\xa0\\nagencies wanted the services of these dogs. The program eventually ended in 1965,\\xa0\\xa0 but Dingo and Count were the first and\\xa0\\nbest recovery missile dogs in history. So what was your favorite Weimaraner fact? Did\\xa0\\nwe miss any that deserve to be on this list?\\xa0\\xa0 Let us know in the comments section below.\\nAnd if you enjoyed this video,\\xa0\\xa0 consider subscribing to The Smart Canine for the\\xa0\\nmost interesting stories and facts behind dogs.'"

       "'And while we still have no idea why the word\\xa0\\n“trumpet” was used to describe this trait,\\xa0\\xa0 we do know that “trumpets” are a beautiful\\xa0\\ncomplement to their facial features. The dog named “Kaydom,”\\xa0\\nwas a 5 year old Weimaraner\\xa0\\xa0 who the owner rescued from\\xa0\\na shelter 3 years prior. These dogs had a 96% recovery rate,\\xa0\\nand the program was so successful\\xa0\\xa0 that numerous military and research\\xa0\\nagencies wanted the services of these dogs. In fact, in the intense heat,\\xa0\\nthese dogs were given a custom\\xa0\\xa0 terry-cloth jacket with pockets to\\xa0\\nhold ice cubes as a way to cool down. No, we’re not saying that\\xa0\\nthese mischievous playful\\xa0\\xa0 dogs are little devils - though\\xa0\\nthey can act like one at times. And according to the 39 year old owner,\\xa0\\nBrian Duff, he was just trying to run as\\xa0\\xa0 fast as he could to keep up with\\xa0\\nKaydom through the mile-long run. And finally, there was the rug\\xa0\\nincident, where Heidi’s bladder\\xa0\\xa0 failed on a 20 thousand dollar rug in\\xa0\\none of the White House reception rooms! And Dingo, along with his German Shorthaired\\xa0\\npointer friend, were crucial in recovering\\xa0\\xa0 pieces of missiles so scientists could study\\xa0\\nthe success or failure of these missiles. Of all the celebrities that\\xa0\\nhave owned a Weimaraner,\\xa0\\xa0 ex US President Dwight D. Eisenhower\\xa0\\nmay be the most famous of them all. In 2016, a man and his furry companion broke the\\xa0\\xa0 unofficial record for the “human-dog\\xa0\\nmile” in Santa Barbara, California. But did you know that the Weimaraner’s breed\\xa0\\xa0 standard is the only standard\\xa0\\nto include the word “trumpet?” But what ultimately landed them the title of “dog\\xa0\\xa0 with a human brain” isn’t from\\xa0\\ntheir obedience and working IQ. They’re so intelligent that they’ve apparently\\xa0\\xa0 earned themselves the nickname,\\xa0\\n“dog with the human brain.” It’s believed that dogs with these “little\\xa0\\xa0 horns” were descended from the\\xa0\\nHarrasburg line of Weimaraners. For example, only 4 breed standards\\xa0\\ninclude the word “majestic.”\\xa0\\xa0  Like did you know they’re\\xa0\\none of the most intelligent\\xa0\\xa0 and clever dog breeds in the canine kingdom? But before we dive in, hit that\\xa0\\nsubscribe button and notification bell\\xa0\\xa0 for more incredible dog facts like these. Number five: Out of all the AKC breed standards,\\xa0\\xa0 only the Weimaraner’s breed\\xa0\\nstandard has this unusual word. Not only are dogs great companions\\xa0\\nand friends, but oftentimes they’ve\\xa0\\xa0 even saved their owners’ lives.\\n The program eventually ended in 1965,\\xa0\\xa0 but Dingo and Count were the first and\\xa0\\nbest recovery missile dogs in history. And if you enjoyed this video,\\xa0\\xa0 consider subscribing to The Smart Canine for the\\xa0\\nmost interesting stories and facts behind dogs.  Otherwise known as the “Gray Ghost,” there’s\\xa0\\nalways been a sense of mystery with these dogs. Herman’s owner got up in the middle of the night\\xa0\\xa0 feeling ill, so he decided to go for a walk around\\xa0\\nthe house and watch some late-night television.\\xa0  In today’s episode,\\xa0\\xa0 we’re counting down the 10 little known\\xa0\\nWeimaraner facts that you didn’t know. Number eight: They’re nicknamed the\\xa0\\n“dog with the human brain” for a reason. Instead of their solid-colored coats,\\xa0\\xa0 Weimaraners are actually born with tiger\\xa0\\nstripes that streak through their entire bodies. This race is essentially a dog on a leash,\\xa0\\nwhile the human and dog run a single mile. So it’s not surprising that\\xa0\\nKaydom and his owner blazed\\xa0\\xa0 through the mile in just 4 minutes and 13 seconds. Instead, the word “trumpet” actually refers to\\xa0\\nthe protruding temples on the Weimaraner’s head. And although some say that this trait\\xa0\\nis seen specifically in Weimaraners,\\xa0\\xa0 it appears that it’s not exclusive to this breed. In fact, it’s why they’re frequently\\xa0\\nknown as the “Harrasburg Horns.” For instance, one reporter stated that\\xa0\\nshe ate two poached eggs on toast,\\xa0\\xa0 along with bacon, for breakfast every single day. And hit that “like” button if\\xa0\\nyou want more Weimaraner videos. Rather, there are some Weimaraners who have a tiny\\xa0\\xa0 flap of skin that sits on their\\xa0\\nhead, right above their ears. Two years later, the heroic\\xa0\\nWeimaraner was inducted into\\xa0\\xa0 Iowa’s Animal Hall of Fame, and rightfully so.'"
