In this project, we’ll develop a YouTube video transcript summarizer that automatically extracts video transcripts from YouTube and generates concise summaries using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and sentence tokenization techniques.

To accomplish this, we’ll utilize the YouTube API to fetch the video based on the provided URL or video ID. Once the video is obtained, we’ll get the text of the video using the transcript.

With the video transcript in hand, we’ll leverage the powerful features of NLTK, a widely used natural language processing library, to tokenize the transcript into individual sentences. This sentence tokenization step allows us to break down the transcript into smaller units for analysis.

To generate the summary, we’ll utilize NLTK’s summarization algorithms. By applying techniques like extractive summarization, we’ll identify the most significant sentences and construct a condensed summary that captures the key points and main ideas of the video.
